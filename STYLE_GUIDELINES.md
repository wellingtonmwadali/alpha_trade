# Alpha Trade Project Style Guidelines

Welcome to the Alpha Trade project! These style guidelines are here to help maintain consistency and readability across the codebase. Please adhere to these guidelines when contributing to the project.

## Code Formatting

- Use consistent indentation: Preferably 4 spaces for each level of indentation.
- Use descriptive variable and function names that convey their purpose.
- Keep lines of code within a reasonable length (typically 80-120 characters).
- Use meaningful comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious behavior.

## Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variable names.
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Use UPPERCASE for constants.
- Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variable, function, or class.

## File Organization

- Organize files logically within directories.
- Separate concerns into different files when it makes sense.
- Use meaningful names for directories and files.

## Documentation

- Document public APIs using JSDoc or a similar documentation format.
- Provide clear and concise explanations for functions, classes, and modules.
- Include information about parameters, return values, and any side effects.
- Keep documentation up-to-date as the code changes.

## Code Quality

- Aim for simplicity and clarity in code design.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or cleverness.
- Write modular and reusable code where possible.
- Follow best practices for error handling and input validation.

## Testing

- Write comprehensive unit tests for all functions and methods.
- Ensure that tests cover both expected and edge cases.
- Use test-driven development (TDD) when appropriate.

## Version Control

- Commit early and often, with clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Keep commits focused on a single logical change.
- Use feature branches for developing new features or fixing bugs.
- Follow the project's branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow).

## Continuous Integration

- Configure automated tests to run on every push or pull request.
- Ensure that the build remains stable and tests pass before merging changes.
- Use code quality tools to identify potential issues early.
